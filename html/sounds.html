				Adaptive music and sound effects with Wwise audio engine
			</p>
			<hr class="my-4" />
			<p>
				Sounds are the core of the game and they are split in two
				categories: music and sound effects. <br />
				For the music I wrote a simple song with very simple chords and
				I recorded instruments that I had at home and for the ones that
				I didn't have I used free VSTi downloaded from the web. The
				Wwise audio engine did handle the tempo and the signature and
				with an index representing the total number of unlocked
				musicians (from 0 to 24) if could control the volume of each
				instrumens as they were unlocked and added to the mix. <br />
				Adding the voice was the mosti difficult part. It had to play a
				random note chosen from the currently played chord, and for that
				I recorded some variation of the same note (C) and created some
				random containers with different pitches that would play a
				random sound from the recorded ones at a random pitch from the
				chord ones. During the playback the chord change and with that
				the voice plays always the correct note. <br />
				For the sound effects I used simple things that I had at home,
				like the computer mouse clik, hand clapping, classical guitar
				effects or downloaded animal sounds.
				<br />
				Here you can listen to some tracks and to some SFX. Play the
				game for discovering how everything works together!
