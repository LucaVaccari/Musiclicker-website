			<p>
				The game is an idle game, that is a game where the player has a
				currency that has to be gained manually by doing things like
				touching the screen or clicking and over time that currency can
				be used to purchase some kind of auto-clicker that get currency
				for you. It's an endless loop that goes on until the player gets
				bored, but I decided to add an objective: reaching level 60 for
				a surprising game ending.
				<br />
				The currency consists of musical notes and you gain them by
				dragging a mixer slider over the screen. Each time it passes
				through the middle it makes the singer sing and gain some notes
				depending on the singer level. You can buy musician that add
				notes each second based on their levels. With notes you can
				level up the singer and the musicians.
			</p>

		<!-- Graphs -->
		<div class="jumbotron bg-yellow">
			<p>
				The game needed some mathematical formulas to decide how many
				notes to give to the player and how many notes to ask for.
				Balancing them has been a difficult task, with hours spent in
				playing the game and deciding where to give more or less, where
				to multiply by 1.15, where to increase the exponent and so on.
				Here are the final results. <br />
				<i>
					In the graphs the y axis represent the number of notes and
					the x axis the time or the number of slides.
				</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				The first two formulas set the number of notes produced by each
				slide and the number of notes required for leveling up the
				singer. The difference has to be quite big, since I didn't want
				the player to reach level 60 without first unlocking all other
				instruments.
			</p>
			<p>NotesPerSlide(Level) = (3.63 / 1.334) ^ Level</p>
			<p>NotesForLevelUp(Level) = (9.72 / 2.5) ^ (Level + 1)</p>
			<canvas id="singer-graph" class=""></canvas>
			<p>
				The next two formulas are a little bit more complicated than the
				first two, since there are 24 musicians and I decided to add a
				parameter, the musician grade, with goes from 1 to 24 and
				represent each musician.
			</p>
			<p>
				NotesPerSecond(Level) = ((grade * 1.421 + 1.56 / 2.1) ^ (Level -
				1) * 10.4
			</p>
			<p>NotesForLevelUp(Level) = (grade + 1.075) * Level * 10.2</p>
